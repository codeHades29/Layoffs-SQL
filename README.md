# Layoffs-SQL
Data cleaning then exploration in Layoffs data

  This was a guided project from Alex the Analyst on Youtube. I used SQL Server Express while Alex was using MYSQL.
This difference in SQLs presented obstacles that made me truly learn how SQL and SQL Server works. 

  The most significat challenge was in exploration where it took me hours to find a workaround for a rolling total. 
However, it was not the rolling total that caused the greatest barrier, but trying to pull YEAR and MONTH out of 
the 'date' column which was a date data type. I feel like I went down every rabbit hole that could be imagined                 (Line 70 of Data Exploration Project 'Layoffs'.sql)
in such a circumstance. I learned so much along the way that I was grateful for the problem after I had found the              (Disclosure: Alex used substring, date, 6, 2)
solution.
